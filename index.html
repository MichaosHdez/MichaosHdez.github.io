            I am an individual with a love for technology. It all started when I used my first computer at the San Francisco library back when I was 9. There was so much to do online. From books to games it was a whole new world for me. Fast forward a couple of years
            and I’ve gone through an IT program called Year Up and my first tech job as a VC tech in IT. I’ve completed the General Assembly and Devboot Camp camps. And I continue to learn anything that I find interesting. At the end of the day my last
            thought is about what I learned today. That pretty much sums it up for me in work in life, what do I know now that I didn’t know before?
